# CSCI-141
Lab Assignments from RIT CSCI-141, an introduction to Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (Python)

This course serves as an introduction to computational thinking using a problem-centered approach. 
Specific topics covered include the following: expression of algorithms in a programming language; functional and 
imperative programming techniques; control structures; problem solving using recursion; basic searching and sorting;
elementary data structures such as lists, trees, and graphs; and correctness, testing and debugging. 
Assignments, both in-class/lab and for homework, require analysis and a code implementation, and are an integral part of the course.
